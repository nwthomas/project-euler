# Project Euler Problem Solutions

According to the [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/about) site, the problems contained on the site are "a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."

#### Who are the problems aimed at?

The site further explains that "The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge."

#### Can anyone solve the problems?

Project Euler intends to expose individuals to a wide range of various problems in degrees of difficulty, and they also build on each other. Solving a singular problem will teach the student a new topic or concept that will allow them to "undertake a previously inaccessible problem." The founders of Project Euler intended that "the determined participant will slowly but surely work his/her way through every problem."
